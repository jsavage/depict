error: failed to select a version for `depict`.
    ... required by package `depict-desktop v0.3.0 (/workspace/dioxus)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.3` (locked to 0.3.0) are: 0.3.0

the package `depict-desktop` depends on `depict`, with features: `osqp` but `depict` does not have these features.
 It has an optional dependency with that name, but that dependency uses the "dep:" syntax in the features table, so it does not have an implicit feature with that name.
